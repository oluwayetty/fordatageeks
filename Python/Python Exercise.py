Perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, - division) on these variables.

String Manipulation:
Declare a string variable and print its length.
Concatenate two strings and print the result.
Extract a substring from a string.

List Handling:
Create a list of numbers and find the sum and average.
Append an element to the list and remove an element from it.
Access specific elements in the list.


Loops:
User Input Validation: Use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for input until they enter a valid number.
'''

# LEVEL TWO
'''
Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string. 
If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. 
If the string length of the given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
Sample String : 'abc' Expected Result : 'abcing' Sample String : 'string' Expected Result : 'stringly'
'''


'''
Create a variable of a list of numbers
Write a python program that returns a list
of the square of each number in the list you created.
E.g 
list_of_nums = [1,4,2]
The program should print [1,16,4]

OPTIONAL EXTENSION: Write another program with same list but 
this time around, the program should return a list of
odd numbers in the list
'''

'''
You are given a list of dictionaries representing information about employees.
Each dictionary contains the employee's name, salary, and department.
Write a python program called that takes the list of dictionaries.
The program should return the name of the employee with the highest salary 

employees = [
    {'name': 'Alice', 'salary': 60000, 'department': 'HR'},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'salary': 75000, 'department': 'Engineering'},
    {'name': 'Charlie', 'salary': 80000, 'department': 'Engineering'},
    {'name': 'David', 'salary': 70000, 'department': 'HR'},
    {'name': 'Eva', 'salary': 90000, 'department': 'Marketing'}
]
In this example, the program should return 'Eva'
'''

a user input is a palindrome, if it is, it says 'It is a palindrome'
otherwise, it tell thems to input a palindrome.
